# Memory System

odek has a **three-tier file-based memory** system. Minimal external dependencies from the 21no.de ecosystem (go-vector, go-mcp), all zero-dep Go packages.

## Three Tiers

```
~/.odek/memory/
├── facts/
│   ├── user.md          ← Global user profile (1,500 chars)
│   └── env.md           ← Global environment facts (2,500 chars)
├── project-facts/       ← Optional per-project overrides (auto-layered)
│   └── <path-hash>/
│       ├── user.md
│       └── env.md
└── episodes/
    ├── <session-id>.md  ← LLM-extracted summaries
    └── index.json       ← Metadata for search
```

### Tier 1 — Facts (in system prompt)

Two typed files, injected as frozen snapshot at session start. Managed by the agent via the `memory` tool.

| Target | File | Cap | Purpose |
|--------|------|-----|---------|
| `user` | `facts/user.md` | 1,500 | User preferences, style, pet peeves |
| `env` | `facts/env.md` | 2,500 | OS, tools, conventions, architecture |

**Frozen snapshot:** Loaded once at agent start into the system prompt. Live writes via the `memory` tool persist to disk immediately but appear in the prompt next session. This preserves LLM prefix caching.

### Tier 2 — Buffer (in session)

Not a file. Lives in `Session.Buffer []string` — a ring buffer capped at 20 lines. The loop engine appends a one-line summary after each turn:

```
HH:MM  user   "fix TOCTOU race"
HH:MM  agent  read file_tool.go, wrote security_e2e_test.go
HH:MM  agent  pushed 19 tests, tagged v0.8.19
```

- Injected into system prompt only when non-empty.
- Preserved across `odek continue` (serialized in session JSON).
- Oldest evicted when cap reached.

### Tier 3 — Episodes (on-disk, searchable)

After sessions with ≥3 turns, the MemoryManager runs SimpleCall to extract 1-3 durable facts. Written to `episodes/<session-id>.md`. Searchable via `memory(search=...)` which uses SimpleCall to rank episodes by relevance to the query.

## Memory Tool — Unified API

```json
{
  "name": "memory",
  "description": "Manage persistent memory across sessions.",
  "parameters": {
    "action": { "enum": ["add", "replace", "remove", "consolidate", "read", "search"] },
    "target": { "enum": ["user", "env"], "description": "For add/replace/remove/consolidate" },
    "content": { "type": "string", "description": "For add/replace" },
    "old_text": { "type": "string", "description": "Unique substring for replace/remove" },
    "query": { "type": "string", "description": "For search — facts + episodes" }
  }
}
```

### Actions

| Action | Target | Content | old_text | Effect |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| `add` | user/env | ✅ new entry | — | Appends to file. Check: dedup + cap + merge |
| `replace` | user/env | ✅ replacement | ✅ substring | Finds entry by substring, replaces it |
| `remove` | user/env | — | ✅ substring | Finds entry by substring, removes it |
| `consolidate` | user/env | — | — | SimpleCall: merge related entries for density |
| `read` | — | — | — | Returns full content of both user.md + env.md |
| `search` | — | — | ✅ query | SimpleCall: rank episodes + facts by relevance |

## Merge-on-Write (go-vector Integration)

When adding a fact, a **two-tier merge detector** classifies the new entry:

```
RP.embed(newEntry) → cos similarity vs each existing entry

  cos > 0.7 ──────────────────→ auto-merge (replace old + new)
  cos < 0.3 ──────────────────→ auto-add (no conflict)
  0.3 ≤ cos ≤ 0.7 ──→ SimpleCall judgment → merge or add
```

This saves ~80% of LLM calls on memory writes.

**Implementation:** `internal/memory/merge.go` imports `github.com/BackendStack21/go-vector/pkg/vector` for `RandomProjections` and `Cosine`. The RP embedder is fit on existing facts when the detector is created, and re-fit whenever facts change.

### Durability & Statefulness

Key design property: **facts persist as text; go-vector RP is ephemeral.**

| Component | Persists to disk? | Source of truth |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Fact text (`user.md`, `env.md`) | ✅ Yes — plain markdown | The text *is* the durable state |
| Episode summaries (`episodes/*.md`) | ✅ Yes — markdown files | Durable |
| Episode index (`episodes/index.json`) | ✅ Yes — JSON | Durable |
| go-vector RP vocabulary + vectors | ❌ No — ephemeral | Rebuilt from text via `Fit()` |

**Why this is safe:** `RandomProjections` is a stateless model. `Fit(corpus)` builds vocabulary from the input text deterministically — same text always produces the same `(word → random vector)` mappings. On every `AddFact` / `Replace` / `Remove`, `MergeDetector.Fit(entries)` is called, reading all facts from disk and recomputing embeddings. No persistent state needs to be saved or restored.

**On restart:**
1. Fact text loads from disk (durable)
2. `MergeDetector` starts with empty corpus + fresh RP
3. First fact mutation triggers `Fit()` with all persisted facts — full merge protection restored
4. Between restart and first mutation, `Classify()` returns `"nobody"` (empty corpus) → entry is added directly without merge checks

This is fine because `MergeDetector` is an optimization (avoids ~80% of LLM calls), not a correctness requirement. Should you want eager initialization, call `memory(action: "read")` on startup — that reads both fact files without side effects while the system prompt already has the frozen snapshot.

### Cold Start

When `facts/user.md` and `facts/env.md` are empty (fresh install), `Fit()` produces an empty corpus. `Classify()` returns `"nobody"` and the entry is added directly — no merge checks, no SimpleCall. After the first few facts are written, subsequent mutations trigger `Fit()` with the growing corpus, and the detector self-trains.

## Subagent Memory

Subagents (separate OS processes via `odek subagent`) inherit a **read-only snapshot** of facts:

```
odek subagent --memory-snapshot /tmp/kode-mem-<rand>.json
```

The subagent's system prompt includes:
```
# Memory Context (read-only)
── User Profile ──
... (facts/user.md)
── Environment ──
... (facts/env.md)
```

Subagents do NOT get a `memory` tool — they cannot modify parent memory.

## Config

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "enabled": true,
    "facts_limit_user": 1500,
    "facts_limit_env": 2500,
    "buffer_lines": 20,
    "buffer_enabled": true,
    "merge_on_write": true,
    "extract_on_end": true,
    "llm_search": true,
    "llm_extract": true,
    "llm_consolidate": true,
    "merge_threshold": 0.7,
    "add_threshold": 0.3
  }
}
```

## Security

All memory content is scanned on write for:
- **Invisible Unicode** (zero-width spaces, RTL override, etc.)
- **Injection patterns** (prompt injection markers)
- **Credential patterns** (`sk-...`, `-----BEGIN`, bearer tokens)

Rejected content returns an error to the agent.
